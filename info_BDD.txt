What is Cucumber?
Cucumber is a tool that supports behavior-driven development (BDD).
 It runs automated acceptance tests written in BDD format.
 Cucumber was originally written in the Ruby programming language and 
 provides a way to write tests that anybody can understand,
  regardless of their technical knowledge. 
  
  It explains test steps and application behaviour in simple English using the Gherkin language.

Why use Cucumber for testing?
Cucumber is important as a testing tool for the following reasons:

Cucumber is open source and free to use.
By using Cucumber, QAs can write your test scripts in multiple languages such as Java, Ruby, .NET, Python, etc.
It integrates with Selenium, Ruby on Rails, Cypress, Watir, and other web-based testing tools.
Cucumber is one of the most widely used BDD tools.

Overview of Behavior Driven Development.............

Behaviour-driven Development (BDD) is a software development technique that has evolved from TDD (Test Driven Development) – a programming practice where the developers write new code only when the automated test case fails.

This approach involves the usage of shared language that enhances communication between various tech and non-tech teams.

Tests are more user-focused and based on the system’s behavior.
In BDD, “Given-When-Then” is the proposed approach for writing test cases.

Focuses on defining ‘behavior’ rather than defining ‘tests’.

Enhances communication among the members of cross-functional product teams.

Helps reach a wider audience via the usage of non-technical language.






How to Integrate Cypress and Cucumber
Let’s first start by installing a Cypress and Cucumber preprocessor.

Step 1: Install Cypress 

Run the following command to install Cypress locally:

 npm install cypress

Step 2: Install Cucumber for Cypress

Run the following command to install the Cucumber for Cypress package: 

npm install –save-dev cypress-cucumber-preprocessor  

Step 3: Add the configuration Cypress environment files

Under plugins/Index.JS file add the following:

const cucumber = require('cypress-cucumber-preprocessor').default 

module.exports = (on, config) => {

  on('file:preprocessor', cucumber())

}

Within the package.json file, add the following configuration:

"cypress-cucumber-preprocessor": {"nonGlobalStepDefinitions": true

In the spec files extension parameter in the cypress.json file, make sure to point to the feature files:

{

  "testFiles": "**/*.feature"

}
